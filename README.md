# MeltySynth

This is an attempt to implement a SoundFont synthesizer in C#.

Currently, some basic operations (note on/off, volume control, program change, and so on) are supported.

The entire code is heavily inspired by the following projects:

* [C# Synth](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=csharpsynthproject) by Alex Veltsistas
* [TinySoundFont](https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont) by Bernhard Schelling


## Demo

Here is a sample audio of "At Doom's Gate" generated with [TimGM6mb](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/soundfonts-and-sfz-files#gm_soundfonts).
