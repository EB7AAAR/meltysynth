# MeltySynth

MeltySynth is a SoundFont synthesizer written in C#.

The entire code is heavily inspired by the following projects:

* [C# Synth](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=csharpsynthproject) by Alex Veltsistas
* [TinySoundFont](https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont) by Bernhard Schelling

An example code to synthesize a simple chord:

```cs
// Create the synthesizer.
var sampleRate = 44100;
var synthesizer = new Synthesizer("TimGM6mb.sf2", sampleRate);

// The output buffer (3 seconds).
var left = new float[3 * sampleRate];
var right = new float[3 * sampleRate];

// Play some notes (middle C, E, G).
synthesizer.NoteOn(0, 60, 100);
synthesizer.NoteOn(0, 64, 100);
synthesizer.NoteOn(0, 67, 100);

// Render the waveform.
synthesizer.Render(left, right);
```


## Features

* No dependencies other than .NET Core 3.1.
* No memory allocation in the rendering process.
* No unsafe code.


## Installation

[The NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MeltySynth/) is available.
