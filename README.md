# MeltySynth

This is an attempt to implement a SoundFont synthesizer in C#. Currently, some basic operations (note on/off, volume control, program change, and so on) are supported.

The entire code is heavily inspired by the following projects:

* [C# Synth](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=csharpsynthproject) by Alex Veltsistas
* [TinySoundFont](https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont) by Bernhard Schelling

An example code to synthesize a simple chord:

```cs
// Create the synthesizer.
var soundFont = new SoundFont("TimGM6mb.sf2");
var sampleRate = 44100;
var synthesizer = new Synthesizer(soundFont, sampleRate);

// The output buffer (2 seconds).
var buffer = new float[2 * sampleRate];

// Play some notes (middle C, E, G).
synthesizer.NoteOn(0, 60, 100);
synthesizer.NoteOn(0, 64, 100);
synthesizer.NoteOn(0, 67, 100);

// Render the waveform.
synthesizer.RenderMono(buffer);
```

## Demo

Here is a sample audio of "At Doom's Gate" generated with [TimGM6mb](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/soundfonts-and-sfz-files#gm_soundfonts).
